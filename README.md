```

## Activation

After having copied the plugin files to the plugins directory, log-in to ILIAS and go to `Administration` > `Extending ILIAS` > `Plugins`.
There, in the corresponding line, you have to click on `Actions` button, then select `Install`.
Do it again, but this time selecting `Activate`.
Then you can go to `Configure`.

## Usage

Concretely, this plugin is going to apply some modifications to the ILIAS code.
First of all it will perform some compatibility checks.
It could be the case that you don't have the writing permissions: in that case you can't apply the modifications and you have to contact the system administration to give to the Apache user (usually `www-data`) the right permissions.
It could also be the case that your ILIAS version is not compatible with the plugin: in that case a warning will be displayed.

To apply the patch, click the button "Enable".
To remove the patch, click the button "Disable".


## Requirements
This plugin is compatible with ILIAS v8.x
